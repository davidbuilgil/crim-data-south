```

Add some context in text. 

Data from The World Bank Data repository (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5?most_recent_year_desc=true&locations=).

We want to compare rates of homicide between East Asia and the rest of the world, and visualise patterns over time.

We begin by loading the required packages in R:

```{r packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(here)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
```

We open the dataset of interest, and select East Asian countries (China, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Mongolia, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan):

```{r open data}
#Read csv file with data
data_homicides <- read.csv(here("data/API_VC.IHR.PSRC.P5_DS2_en_csv_v2_5996865.csv"),
                           skip = 3) #Skip first three rows (no data)

#Make list of countries of interest
countries_interest <- c("China", "Hong Kong SAR, China", "Japan",
                        "Korea, Rep.", "Macao SAR, China", "Mongolia",
                        "Korea, Dem. People's Rep.", "World")

#Select countries in the list
data_homicides <- data_homicides %>%
  filter(Country.Name %in% countries_interest)

```

We are only interested in those countries that have complete data between 2000 and 2020. We select columns of interest, tidy up the column names, filter out countries without complete data, and gather columns (years) to rows.

```{r filter}
data_homicides <- data_homicides %>%
  #Select columns of interest
  select(Country.Name, X2000:X2020) %>%
  #Remove X from column names
  rename_with(~str_replace(., "^X", ""), starts_with("X")) %>% 
  #Filter out incomplete cases
  filter(complete.cases(.)) %>%
  #Gather columns to a rows
  gather(Year, "Homicide rate", -Country.Name)

```

We loose Mongolia, China and North Korea.

We may be interested in knowing the average homicide rate across countries, and its variance over the years.

```{r descriptives}
data_homicides %>%
  group_by(Country.Name) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(`Homicide rate`),
            variance = var(`Homicide rate`))
  
```

Finally, we may want to display it in a temporal line graph:

```{r graph print, include = FALSE}
ggplot(data_homicides, aes(x = Year, y = `Homicide rate`, 
                           group = Country.Name)) +
  #Visualise each country with a different color
  geom_line(aes(color = Country.Name)) +
  #Add title
  ggtitle("Intentional homicide rate (per 100,000 people)") +
  #Classic graph theme
  theme_classic()

ggsave(here("exemplar-activities/east-asia-trend.png"), 
       width = 10, height = 5)

```

```{r graph, message = FALSE, fig.show = 'hide'}
ggplot(data_homicides, aes(x = Year, y = `Homicide rate`, 
                           group = Country.Name)) +
  #Visualise each country with a different color
  geom_line(aes(color = Country.Name)) +
  #Add title
  ggtitle("Intentional homicide rate (per 100,000 people)") +
  #Classic graph theme
  theme_classic()

```

```{r graph display, echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(here("exemplar-activities/east-asia-trend.png"))

```
