In this spatial analysis activity, we explore the spatial distribution of kidnapping crime in Mexico. Kidnapping, defined as the unlawful abduction or captivate of individuals against their will, carries profound security implications. Within the context of Mexico, kidnapping is closely linked to organised crime, particularly drug cartels, and poses a challenge to national security (Jones, 2013; Massa and Fondevila, 2021; Ochoa, 2012, 2019). Kidnapping in Mexico is largely associated to the demand for illicit substances in the United States, leading to substantial financial costs for Mexican criminal organisations. These groups also exploit individuals, including children, for various criminal purposes, including kidnappings. Understanding the geographic distribution of these crimes may help developing better-informed crime prevention policies targeting areas that concentrate most offenses.

In this exemplar study we utilize police-recorded crime data released by the National Public Security System (SNSP) through the official portal of the Mexican Government [https://www.gob.mx/sesnsp/acciones-y-programas/datos-abiertos-de-incidencia-delictiva?state=published](https://www.gob.mx/sesnsp/acciones-y-programas/datos-abiertos-de-incidencia-delictiva?state=published).

We begin by loading the required packages in R.

```{r packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(here) # to identify the path to the data
library(readr) # to read in CSV data
library(dplyr) # for data wrangling
library(ggplot2) # for data visualization
library(sf) # for spatial data manipulation and visualization
library(viridis) # for color schemes
```

The data are saved in a CSV (comma-separated data) and we employ the `read_csv()` function from the `readr` package, specifying the Latin1 encoding to correctly import the crime data into the `data_Mexico` object.

```{r open data, message=FALSE}
#Read csv file with crime data
data_Mexico <- read_csv(here("data/IDM_nov2023.csv"), locale = locale(encoding = "Latin1"))

```

We examine the dataset and identify the three variables of interest. 
- `TIPO` (in English 'TYPE': type of crime)
- `AÑO` (in English 'YEAR': year of crime recorded)
- `ENTIDAD` (in English 'ENTITY': state of Mexico)

The data contains 18 different crime types across 32 federal entities in Mexico from 2011 to 2017. To prepare the data for analysis, we first reshape the dataset by filtering the records specific to the year 2017 and the crime type `SECUESTRO` (i.e., kidnapping).

```{r filter data}
data_Mexico <- data_Mexico %>%
  filter(TIPO == "SECUESTRO") %>% # filter SECUESTRO
  filter(AÑO == 2017) # filter 2017
```

We create a table which contains two columns: the state name (`ENTIDAD`) and the total number of kidnappings for each state. The data records kidnapping crimes monthly, with separate columns for each month of the year. To calculate the annual total for each state, we use the `rowSums()` function, and specify the columns to be included using the `accross()` function. It is important to set the `na.rm` parameter to `TRUE` to ensure that missing data (NAs) are just treated as 0 (i.e., no kidnapping crimes occurred in those months).

```{r clean data}
data_Mexico <- data_Mexico %>%
  mutate(sum_secuestro = rowSums(across(8:19), # create new variable of sums
                                 na.rm = TRUE)) # treat NA as 0 here
```

We then compute the total number kidnappings in each state (`ENTIDAD`) in 2017. By using the `group_by()` and `summarise()` functions, we create a frequency table, which is saved as a new object called `data_Mexico_states`. In this table, each row corresponds to each state, providing a overview of kidnappings in 2017.

```{r calculate per state}
#Calculate number of crimes in each state
data_Mexico_states <- data_Mexico %>%
  group_by(ENTIDAD) %>% #group by state
  summarise(secuestro = sum(sum_secuestro)) # sum all kidnappings in the state
```

We observe the top three states (MEXICO, TAMAULIPAS, and VERACRUZ) stand out, with remarkably larger number of kidnappings that the rest of the country. To assess if these states are more at risk to kidnappings, we considered the kidnapping rate per population. It is possible that the three states have higher kidnapping counts because they have large populations, where more people can lead more crime incident, including kidnappings. To account this, we calculate kidnapping rates per 100,000 residents. We obtained census data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI): https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/tabulados/default.html?nc=mdemo02.

To link the population data with the kidnapping data, we combined the two tables using a common identifier, which remains as `ENTIDAD` in the crime data and `STATE` in INEGI's population statistics. We employ the left_join() function.

```{r population merge}
#Read csv file with population data
population <- read_csv(here("data/Population2010.csv"))

#Merge with crime data and calculate crime rates
data_Mexico_states <- data_Mexico_states %>%
  left_join(population, by = c("ENTIDAD" = "STATE")) %>%
  mutate(secuestro_rate = secuestro / Population2010 * 100000)
```

We examine the top 5 states with the highest kidnapping rate per 100,000.

```{r}
top_n(data_Mexico_states, 3, secuestro_rate)
```

We observe that the states with the highest kidnapping rates are Tabasco and Zacatecas. Tamaulipas consistently stood out in both a high count and a high rate of kidnappings. This highlights the significant of exploring potential problem-solving interventions to mitigate kidnapping incident in this region. 

To further our understanding, we examine the spatial distribution of kidnappings and inspect any potential spatial relationships among these states through a thematic map. The spatial data in JSON format used in this exercise was obtained from the following source: [https://github.com/strotgen/mexico-leaflet/](https://github.com/strotgen/mexico-leaflet/).

To link geographical information with kidnapping rates, we begin by importing geospatial data, which represents the Mexican state's boundaries. We then standardise state names and merge the geospatial data with the kidnapping data to create a new data for spatial analysis. 

```{r load map, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
#Read geojson of Mexico states
#states_geojson <- st_read("https://github.com/strotgen/mexico-leaflet/blob/master/states.geojson")
states_geojson <- st_read(here("data/states.geojson"))

#Merge crime rates with geojson file
states_geojson <- states_geojson %>%
  mutate(state_name = toupper(state_name), #capital letters for consistency
         state_name = recode(state_name, #rename some states for consistency
                             'DISTRITO FEDERAL' = 'CIUDAD DE MEXICO',
                             'MÉXICO' = 'MEXICO',
                             'MICHOACÁN DE OCAMPO' = 'MICHOACAN',
                             'QUERÉTARO' = 'QUERETARO',
                             'SAN LUIS POTOSÍ' = 'SAN LUIS POTOSI',
                             'VERACRUZ DE IGNACIO DE LA LLAVE' = 'VERACRUZ',
                             'NUEVO LEÓN' = 'NUEVO LEON',
                             'COAHUILA DE ZARAGOZA' = 'COAHUILA',
                             'YUCATÁN' = 'YUCATAN')) %>% 
  left_join(data_Mexico_states, by = c("state_name" = "ENTIDAD"))
```

We generate a heatmap of kidnapping rates across Mexican states utilising the `ggplot2` package and customise the fill colors. The output has been saved as a PNG file named 'Mexico_map.png' in the specified directory.

```{r visualise map no show}
ggplot(data = states_geojson) +
  ggtitle("Rate of kidnappings per 100,000 residents in Mexico states") +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = secuestro_rate)) +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "magma") +
  theme_void()

ggsave(here("exemplar-activities/Mexico_map.png"), 
       width = 10, height = 7)
```

The heatmap illustrates the rate of kidnapping per 100,000 population across 32 states in Mexico. Yellow/orange shades on the map indicate higher kidnapping rates, while darker shades represent lower rates. These variations provide valuable insights for targeted interventions, highlighting areas where increased law enforcement resources may be necessary to effectively address and mitigate kidnapping incidents. This spatial analysis underscores the influence of strategic choices in crime prevention.

```{r visualise map display, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here("exemplar-activities/Mexico_map.png"))
